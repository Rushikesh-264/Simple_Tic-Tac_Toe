# Tic-Tac_Toe Game
--------------------
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This simple yet classic game allows two players to compete against each other in a battle of Xs and Os. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your own symbols on the game board.

How to Play
------------
    Setup:
        The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
        The players have to enter the name to make it more interactive
        Two players take turns marking an empty cell with their respective symbols.
        The first player uses "X," and the second player uses "O."

    Gameplay:
        Players take turns making a move by selecting an empty cell to place their symbol.
        The game continues until one player wins by forming a line of three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if the board is filled without a winner, resulting in a tie.

    Winning:
        The game is won by the first player to get three of their symbols in a row.
        The three symbols can be aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

    Tie:
        If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
